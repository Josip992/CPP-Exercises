# CPP-Exercises
Some assignments from the 'Object-oriented Programming' course at University Department of Professional Studies in Split and some extra work

Course Description/Course Objectives:

Understanding the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming with an emphasis on the C++ programming language.
Working with the standard library, with a focus on STL.

Theoretical and practical preparation of students for writing object-oriented programs.

Learning Outcomes:
Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

Define the fundamental concepts and principles of object-oriented programming (knowledge).
Describe the ways of applying objects and classes as the basic elements in object-oriented programming (understanding).

Demonstrate the use of inheritance (application).
Calculate the efficiency of programming using object-oriented principles (classes and inheritance) (analysis).

Propose a class definition that will meet predefined parameters (synthesis).

Choose an engineering approach to problem-solving, based on the acquired knowledge of classes and inheritance (evaluation).
Course Outline:
Introduction. Overview of programming techniques. Differences between C and C++. Pointers and references.

Heap allocation. Classes and objects. Function and operator overloading. Inheritance. Polymorphism.
